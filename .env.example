# API Key Configuration
# This API key is used for securing the mail sending functionality.
# Any request to the /send endpoint must include this API key in the request body
# as the "apiKey" variable. Requests without a matching API key will be rejected.
# This ensures that only authorized clients can use the mail sending service.
# You can use any string as the API key, but it's recommended to use a long and complex key for security.
